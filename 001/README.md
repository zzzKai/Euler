## linear scan
We can scan the array and check each number. If the number can be divided by the 3 or 5 then we add that to the answer.

time: O(n)<1>
space: O(1)
## add all and remove what we don't want 
We can add them the numbers that are the multiple of 3 or 5. In this case we will remove the numbers that are the multiple of 3 and 5, because they are added twice.
