## brutal force
first * second = result<br>
for the first number: 1 - 100, because this is the smaller one, because 100 * 100 -> length of 3 + 3 + 5 > 9<br>
for the second number: larger than the first number to avoid duplicate.<br>
res: the numbers in 1 - 9 left<br>
if length of all 3 part together > 9 stop itrating.
